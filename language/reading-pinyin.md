<h2>Reading Standard Chinese Pinyin<br><em>Hànyǔ Pīnyīn</em></h2>

<section class="example-image">
  <p>
    This is the official Romanisation system of Standard Chinese, 普通話 : 普通话 <strong>Pǔtōnghuà</strong>, which is based on the Mandarin dialect of Northeastern China. The Pinyin system is used in mainland China and was endorsed by the government in 1958.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here follows a very, very rough guide to pronouncing pinyin. If you want to learn properly, please consult a teacher!
  </p>

  <h3>Single consonants</h3>
  <p>
    The easiest of all the consonants is 'v' - because it is not used!
  </p>
  <p>The next easiest are the ones pronounced as in English:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>b</strong> as in bed</li>
    <li><strong>d</strong> as in dad</li>
    <li><strong>f</strong> as in fun</li>
    <li><strong>g</strong> as in golf (but not as in gym)</li>
    <li><strong>h</strong> as in hand</li>
    <li><strong>k</strong> as in kind</li>
    <li><strong>l</strong> as in love</li>
    <li><strong>m</strong> as in mum</li>
    <li><strong>n</strong> as in no</li>
    <li><strong>p</strong> as in pet</li>
    <li><strong>s</strong> as in sun</li>
    <li><strong>t</strong> as in tan</li>
    <li><strong>w</strong> as in win</li>
    <li><strong>y</strong> as in yes</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The remaining consonants are pronounced as below:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>c</strong> like the 'ts' sound in 'cats'</li>
    <li><strong>q</strong> like combining the 'ts' sound in 'cats' with the 'y' sound in 'yes' to make 'tsy'</li>
    <li><strong>z</strong> like the 'dz' sound in 'adds'</li>
    <li><strong>j</strong> like combining the 'dz' sound in 'adds' with the 'y' sound in 'yes' to make 'dzy'</li>
    <li><strong>r</strong> like the 'r' in 'run', but keep the tongue further back in the mouth</li>
    <li><strong>x</strong> try pronouncing the 'ssie' sound harshly in the French word 'assiette'. Or try saying a normal 's' whilst holding the tongue closer to the roof of your mouth so that air has to be forced out.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Digraphs</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>ch</strong> as in church</li>
    <li><strong>sh</strong> as in shirt</li>
    <li><strong>zh</strong> like the 'j' sound in 'jam'</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Single vowels</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>a</strong> is an open sound, like when you say 'Ah' for the dentist!</li>
    <li><strong>e</strong> can be approximated to the 'schwa' sound, e.g. the way 'e' is pronounced in the word 'taken'</li>
    <li><strong>i</strong> has two possible pronunciations:
      <ul>
        <li>in <em>si</em>, <em>ci</em>, <em>zi</em> and <em>ri</em> it is pronounced like the 'i' in 'sir'</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
