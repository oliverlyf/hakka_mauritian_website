# Eh, eh & eh! 欸

<!-- Romanization and pronunciation guide for the Hakka character 欸 -->
<p><em>āi : ê(2) / ê(3)</em></p>

<!-- Personal anecdote introduction explaining curiosity about the use of 'eh' -->
<p>
When I was younger, I was mystified as to why my parents kept on adding this 'eh' sound to every other word when they were speaking Hakka. 
"... Yinguêd loiyeh... tai moiyeh... laiyeh... suneh..." 
After about 12 years I finally found out the answer in the 4-way dictionary I bought in Moiyan!
