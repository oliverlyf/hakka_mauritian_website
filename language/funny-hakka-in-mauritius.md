# Funny Hakka in Mauritius

<!-- Introduction paragraph explaining the phenomenon of Creole/French/English words adapted to sound like Hakka -->
<p>
A few amusing words that I came across when talking to Hakka-Mauritians were those that had been borrowed from Mauritian Creole/French/English and made to sound like Hakka. The (randomly spelled!) examples I found were:

<p>I'd love to add more if you can think of any!</p>

<!-- Anecdote illustrating the confusion caused by these words -->
<p>

Thanks to Ah Yee No. 3 and Yee Chong, who have remembered some more funny Creole-Hakka words:
</p>

<!-- Additional funny words list -->
<ul>
  <li><strong>La-vang-ha</strong> for 'la varangue' (veranda)</li>
  <li><strong>Si-ma-naye</strong> for 'ciment' (cement)</li>
  <li><strong>La-su-tik</strong> for 'elastique'</li>
  <li><strong>Pang-leh-song</strong> for 'prendre des leçons', that is, taking extra tuition after school...</li>

<!-- Thanks to another contributor -->
<p>Thanks to GSY:</p>

<!-- More words from GSY -->
<ul>
  <li><strong>an-ma-se</strong> for 'Champs de Mars' (racecourse)</li>
  <li><strong>Or-chin</strong> for the town of 'Rosehill' (doesn't sound very similar, but I guess to the original Chinese this was the closest they could get?)</li>
  <li><strong>Ma-ta-kwee</strong> for 'police' - one of our Malaysian readers confirms that 'mata' means 'eyes' in Malay and is used to refer to the police, whilst 'kwee' is a commonly-used Hakka word for 'ghost', often used as a derogatory term.</li>
  <li><strong>Li-su-choy</strong> or 'le chou'</li>
</ul>

<!-- Personal family anecdotes -->
<p>
My dad recalls referring to La Réunion as <em>phu-lo-vong</em>, possibly derived from its former name of 'Île Bourbon' and to Rodrigues as <em>lo-ti-li</em>.
</p>

<p>
My mum, on hearing <em>li-su-choy</em>, suddenly remembered that from <em>li-su-choy</em> you can make <em>yaa-saa</em>, otherwise known as 'achard'!
