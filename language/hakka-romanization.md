# Hakka Romanization

<!-- Introduction about the romanization system and its origin -->
<p>
I have used the romanization system as set up by the Guangdong Provincial Education Department in 1960. Please <a href="#">click here</a> for a summary in Chinese.
</p>

<!-- Explanation about avoiding gallicized spellings -->
<p>
This means that I will be avoiding the gallicized Hakka spellings that are commonly used in Mauritius, such as in names like 'Ah Voune' and 'Ah Youille' (although I am quite fond of them and they are a unique linguistic specimen!). 
</p>

<!-- Rough guide introduction -->
<p>Here follows a very, very rough guide to pronouncing Hakka.</p>

<!-- Section: Consonants -->
## CONSONANTS

<!-- Subsection: consonants pronounced as in English -->
### Consonants pronounced as in English:

<ul>
  <li>f as in fun</li>
  <li>h as in hand</li>
  <li>l as in love</li>
  <li>m as in mum</li>
  <li>n as in no</li>
  <li>s as in sun</li>
  <li>v as in van</li>
</ul>

<!-- Subsection: consonants with subtle differences -->
### Consonants with subtle differences:

<ul>
  <li>b like the unaspirated 'p' in 'spell'</li>
  <li>p like the aspirated 'p' in 'pat'</li>
  <li>d like the unaspirated 't' in 'stay'</li>
  <li>t like the aspirated 't' in 'tap'</li>
  <li>g like the unaspirated 'k' in 'skill'</li>
  <li>k like the aspirated 'k' in 'kiss'</li>
</ul>

<!-- Subsection: trickier consonants -->
### Trickier ones:

<ul>
  <li>z like a cross between the 'dz' sound in 'adds' and the 'ts' sound in 'cats' e.g. congee 粥 zug(5)</li>
  <li>j like z above but used only when the next letter is 'i' e.g. older sister 姊 ji(3)</li>
  <li>c like the 'ts' sound in 'cats' e.g. car/vehicle 车 ca(1)</li>
  <li>q like c (above) but used only when the next letter is 'i' e.g. seven 七 qid(5)</li>
  <li>x like a cross between 's' and 'sh' e.g. small 小 xiau(3)</li>
  <li>ng [+a or +o] like the 'ng' in 'song' e.g. I, me 𠊎 ngai(2)</li>
  <li>ng [+i] like the 'ny' in 'can you' e.g. person 人 ngin(2)</li>
</ul>

<!-- Section: Vowels -->
## VOWELS (British Pronunciation!)

<ul>
  <li>a as in 'at' e.g. tea 茶 ca(2)</li>
  <li>ê as in 'let' e.g. North 北 bêd(5)</li>
  <li>e as the 'schwa' sound in 'taken' e.g. eat 食 sed(6)</li>
  <li>i as in 'fin' e.g. gold 金 gim(1) (except in the combinations 'si' and 'zi', where the 'i' is pronounced like a longer version of the 'schwa' sound mentioned above)</li>
  <li>o as in 'on' e.g. egg 卵 lon(3)</li>
  <li>u like a shorter version of the 'oo' in 'too' e.g. red 红 fung(2)</li>
