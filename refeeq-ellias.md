  <h3>The Legend of Fat Mama</h3>
  <p>
    Hope you enjoy this fascinating documentary by photographer and film-maker Rafeeq Ellias of India. Here is the introduction to the film, taken from his website:
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>The Legend of Fat Mama:</em> A multiple award winning documentary by Rafeeq Ellias for BBC World, broadcast in over 200 countries, it is the story of India's tiny Chinese community in Kolkata's 'melting wok'. It is the first film ever to document the trauma of incarceration and deportation of Chinese families after the India-China war in 1962. It is also about the ties that bind: from chow mein and tandoori chicken to Bollywood music!
